# NaughtsAndCrosses

This was coded in eclipse but I have edited it so that it can be run within VSCode.
To run simply cloen the repo and open the GameClass.java and hit run.

If you would like to run wihtout entering an IDE then open your terminal and navigate to project where you have saved it
compile by doing javac on the GameClass.java file
and then type java GameClass and enter

the frame will pop up but there may be an issue with the images.

I recommend running within VSCode as it is or in Eclipse, but for eclipse you would have to edit the path for ImageIcon within init_icons() from "NaughtsAndCrossesEx/x.png" to "res/x.png" so that the images will display when playing
